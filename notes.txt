    optimization - done
        this saves 18% space when tested with 72KB file
        shortner - to shorten the keys before making API call
        expander - to expand the keys before initializing the editor

whats next
done - proposal converter script - combine all the modules created so far and create a single converter script that that will take draft.js proposal as input and will output as lexical version of the proposal.
create a POC editor to compare the results
once things looks good we can assume that draft to lexical conversion is working 99% perfect


To optimize the JSON:
1 - remove editorState

2. Shorten Keys: Replace verbose keys with shorter ones
  f = format
  i = indent
  v = version
  c = children
  t = text
  s = style

3. Remove Defaults: Strip out fields that match the global defaults.
4. Compress Text: Use libraries like lz-string to compress text nodes.
